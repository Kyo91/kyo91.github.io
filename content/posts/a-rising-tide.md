Advice comes in many forms: there's good and bad, welcome and unwelcome, requested and thrust-upon, and the type that comes wrapped in small fortune cookies. However lately I've been noticing a lot of "advice" that is really just anecdotes phrased as advice. This is by no means new -- I'm sure many of my fellow Millenials know the stereotype of a Boomer telling us "youngins" how he got a job "back in the day" -- but when marketed well, this pseudoadvice becomes quite persuasive. More than that, many whom I consider peers will actively seek out these anecdotes. I've tried to fight against this tide as I can, but figured it would be wise to collect all my thoughts here to save myself the trouble. After all, as a good programmer I am inherently [lazy](https://wiki.c2.com/?LazinessImpatienceHubris): better to write my point once than in a hundred duplicate fragments.


## Real Estate Made Simple {#real-estate-made-simple}

[Graham Stephan](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCV6KDgJskWaEckne5aPA0aQ) used to be a huge guilty pleasure of mine. I emphasize past tense here because I have some notion that his content has continued to evolve since he dropped off my Youtube feed[^fn:1] and I don't want to give the false impression that I'm familiar with anything he has posted since mid 2021 or so. For those who aren't familiar with him, Graham Stephan is a very successful millenial realtor, real estate investor, and Youtuber. While he has released plenty of [silly](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N049u8B184g) videos, the vast majority of his content essentially revolves around investing and financial advice[^fn:2].


## FIRE Advice or giving walkthroughs in a rougelike {#fire-advice-or-giving-walkthroughs-in-a-rougelike}

[^fn:1]: Coincidentally I think the last video of his I saw was about him divesting from new Real Estate projects.
[^fn:2]: "Financial Advice" has a very heavy legal weight to it and he makes it very clear that none of his videos should be taken as being financial advice, just information. However, I don't think Graham would deny that many people turn to his content as advice and much of his content was focused on helping others break into real estate. As such, I will continue to refer to his content as advice for the purpose of this blog.
